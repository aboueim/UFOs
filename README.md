# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project

In this project, I aimed to build a webpage that allows users to search and filter out UFO sightings stored in an HTML table. In doing so, I wrote javascript and html codes to design and actualize the webpage. Specifically, as the backbone of the webpage, the html code enforced a desired layout and visualizations such as a navigator, heading, a short article, and a table. Besides, the webpage is designed in a way that the table is filled with UFO sighting data which can be filtered given the date and time of sightings, their location (i.e., country, state, city) and shape. This became possible with the help of the javascript code which allowed reading UFO sighting data, loading it to the HTML table, and enabling filtering via calling jvacscript functions. In the following, I provided more details on the filtering process on the webpage and the associated results.

## Results

Once opening the webpage, a user can see a table at the bottom of the page where a large set of UFO sightings are stored based on their date and time of occurence, location, shape and comments written about them (see the screenshot below). On the left side of the table, there are five filtering options are located that allow users to search sightings given their date, city, state, country, and shape.

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
