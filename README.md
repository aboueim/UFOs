# Project Name: UFO Sighting

# Overview of Project

In this project, I aimed to build a webpage that allows users to search and filter out UFO sightings stored in an HTML table. In doing so, I utilized an array of UFO sighting data storing details (including date and time of the sighting, location, shape, duration, and descriptive comments)


Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
